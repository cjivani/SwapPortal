                <p>futXchange was founded by shoe fanatics who have been passionate about wearing sneakers. We have been
                    crazy about sneakers even longer, and labeled Sneaker Heads since the era
                    of the stylish sneakers really took off.
                <p>When the retro shoes started becoming a fashion trend we could reach back in our closets and pull out
                    the originals and still look modern. SwapSneaker opens our closets, along with the closets of an
                    entire community of people all around the world. !</p>
                <p>Here, you can swap your classics with other Shoe lovers around the world to build and expand your
                    collection. Donâ€™t feel like swapping? Sell your sneakers securely to someone missing that essential
                    pair.</p>
